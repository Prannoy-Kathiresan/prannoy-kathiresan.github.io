        <h3>
            This project is based on automobile manufacturers' data from 2017. The dataset consists of various car models from different manufacturers and their corresponding engine cylinders, along with the car's MPG (Fuel Efficiency) for both city and highway driving zones. The data reveals correlations between the number of cylinders in a car, its fuel type, and ultimately, its fuel efficiency in different driving zones. Let's delve into some critical details in the following scenes. (            <a href="https://flunky.github.io/cars2017.csv">Link for data</a>)
